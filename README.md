### What is Limine?

Limine (pronounced as demonstrated [here](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/in%20limine))
is a modern, advanced, portable, multiprotocol bootloader and boot manager, also used
as the reference implementation for the [Limine boot protocol](PROTOCOL.md).

## Binary releases

For convenience, for point releases, binaries are distributed. These binaries
are shipped in the `-binary` branches and tags of this repository
(see [branches](https://github.com/limine-bootloader/limine/branches/all) and
[tags](https://github.com/limine-bootloader/limine/tags)).

For example, to clone the latest binary release of the `9.x` branch, one can do:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/limine-bootloader/limine.git --branch=v9.x-binary --depth=1
```
or, to clone a specific binary point release (for example `9.3.2`):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/limine-bootloader/limine.git --branch=v9.3.2-binary --depth=1
```

In order to rebuild host utilities like `limine`, simply run `make` in the binary
release directory.

Host utility binaries are provided for Windows.
